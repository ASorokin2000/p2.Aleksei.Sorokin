<h3> Key Assumption about the design </h3>
<p> In a real design, it will be a mirror. However, for this project I will try to use webcamera and put the picture from it as a background. It will be instead of the actual mirror </p>
<p> All items are showed in a short version initially. They take around 50% of the screen. The rest works as a mirror.</p>
<p> However, user has two opetions.</p>
<p> 1) Tap an item once and open the full version of item. For example, a calendar for the whole day, and not just for the nearest event</p>
<p> 2) click quickly 2 times and drag the item. So, it won't take a lot of space. You can use it if you need more space for the actual mirror image.</p>
