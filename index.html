  Project 2: Personal Magic Mirror

<h2> Part C Sketch </h2>
<img src="p2.Aleksei.Sorokin.png" width = 1000>
<h3> Key Assumption about the design </h3>
<p> In a real design, it will be a mirror. However, for this project I will try to use webcamera and put the picture from it as a background. It will be instead of the actual mirror </p>
<p> All items are showed in a short version initially. They take around 50% of the screen. The rest works as a mirror.</p>
<p> My design was inspired by Microsoft Windows design on my laptop.
<p> However, user has two options.</p>
<p> 1) Tap an item once and open the full version of item. For example, a calendar for the whole day, and not just for the nearest event</p>
<p> 2) click quickly 2 times and drag the item. So, it won't take a lot of space. You can use it if you need more space for the actual mirror image.</p>
<h3> Features included in the design</h3>
<p> 1) Time and Date <br> Located in the bottom right corner. If you double click, it will expand and you can change the time zone and settings.
</p>
<p> 2) Weather <br> Located in the bottom right corner, next to the time and date. current temprature and the icon for sunny, windy, rainy weather initially. <br> 
 If you double click, it will expand and you will see the forecast for the day or for the week.
</p>
<p> 3) Social Feed <br> Located in the center right part. It's connected to your social media profiles and shows how many notificanions, messages etc. you have. <br>
  Ideally, You should be able to open the profile in the selected social media if you click on it.
</p>
<p> 4) Text Messages <br> Located right up to the social feed part. It shows how many new messages you have. If you double click on it it will open the message menu with all your conversations. 
</p>
<p> 5) Calendar <br> Located in the top right corner. Initially, it shows only one upcoming event. <br> However, if you double click on it, it will show the whole calendar. You should be able to add new events and delete the existing ones.
</p>
<p> 6) News Feed <br> Located in the bottom left area. Initially, it shows only shortcuts of 3 important news. <br>
  If you click on them, you can read the whole article.
</p>
<p> 7) Health info <br>
  Located in the left top corner. Initially it shows only the current metrics and the daily change. <br>
  If you double click you will get access to the all-time statistic. <br>
  Metrics include: Weight, sleep time (d-deep and l-light), Mirror morning time(M Sun), Mirror eveing time(M half moon), steps, time stood and time exercised.
</p>
<p> 8) Microphone and Speaker <br> The Microphone is located in bottom center are. The Speaker is located in the top center area. <br>
  The main idea of their design was to make them as small as possible. So, they leave more space for the actual mirror image. <br>
  They are the only parts in the mirror that are not touch sensitive. They will help with the voice recognition part.

<h3> Problems in implementation </h3>
<p>  1) The technical part took too much time. So, I couldn't really focus on the design </p>
<p> 2) I've implemented an extended view only for about a half of elements: Calendar, Social Feed, Messages </p>
<p> 3) It was hard to find good colors because еру background can change</p>
<h3> Key Assumptions </h3>
<p> 1) I used a web camera image instead of a mirror image </p>
<p> 2) All the data is stored in csv files. The information was created by me.  </p>
<p> 3) Calendar, News Feed, Date_and_Time, Health Info check the date and upload the relevant information</p>
<p> 4) If you click on any item, it shows the detailed view for this item. Unfortunately, I managed to do it only for 3 top right elements</p>
<p> 5) To exit the detailed view, a user has to click on the button located in the upper right corner</p>
<p> 6) I made a grid for the health information to make it more distinguishable</p>
