  Project 2: Personal Magic Mirror
</h1>
<h2> Part C Sketch </h2>
<img src="p2.Aleksei.Sorokin.png" width = 1000>
<h3> Key Assumption about the design </h3>
<p> In a real design, it will be a mirror. However, for this project I will try to use webcamera and put the picture from it as a background. It will be instead of the actual mirror </p>
<p> All items are showed in a short version initially. They take around 50% of the screen. The rest works as a mirror.</p>
<p> However, user has two opetions.</p>
<p> 1) Tap an item once and open the full version of item. For example, a calendar for the whole day, and not just for the nearest event</p>
<p> 2) click quickly 2 times and drag the item. So, it won't take a lot of space. You can use it if you need more space for the actual mirror image.</p>
<h3> Features included in the design</h3>
<p> 1) Time and Date <br> Located in the bottom right corner. If you double click, it will expand and you can change the time zone and settings.
</p>
<p> 2) Weather <br> Located in the bottom right corner, next to the time and date. current temprature and the icon for sunny, windy, rainy weather initially. <br> 
 If you double click, it will expand and you will see the forecast for the day or for the week.
</p>
<p> 3) Social Feed <br> It's connected to your social media profiles and shows how many notificanions, messages etc. you have. <br>
  Ideally, You should be able to open the profile in the selected social media if you click on it.
</p>
<p> 4) Text Messages <br> It shows 
</p>
<p> 5) Calendar</p>
<p> 6) News Feed</p>
<p> 7) Health info</p>
<p> 8) Microphone and Speaker</p>
